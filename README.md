# Database project that runs on a network

This project was built to help improve my understanding of C and networking in C.
The database is just a file with a simple header to verify validity of data. Think of this as 
[Turso](https://turso.tech/) minus all the impressive things of both Turso and Sqlite.

I still would continue to use Go for all my programming needs but I've found a new appreciation for C.
If anything, it's helped me understand the hardware better, in turn making me a better programmer. I hope.

## Make

Make is awesome. It's the bulid system for the project. Simple run `make` to get everything up and ready. It builds 
all the objects and ensures both the server and the client are up and running on the port you have specified.

## Shoutout to Low Level Learning

This project and my understanding of C would have taken me years to get to this point, if I were 
to do it on my own. Also, for inspiring me to dive deeper into programming.
