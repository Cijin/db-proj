# Database project that runs on a network

This project was built to help improve my understanding of C and networking in C.
The database is just a file with a simple header to verify validity of data. Think of this as 
[Turso](https://turso.tech/) minus all the impressive things of both Turso and Sqlite.

I still would continue to use Go for all my programming needs but I've found a new appreciation for C.
If anything, it's helped me understand the hardware better, in turn making me a better programmer. I hope.

## Shoutout to Low Level Learning

This project and my understanding of C would have taken me years to get to this point, if I were 
to do it on my own. You can find all things Low level [here](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning).
